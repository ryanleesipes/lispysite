My name is Ryan Sipes, and I'm happy to announce that I am acting as an advisor and consultant for Lispy Snake! When I first heard that Ikey was working on something new I became intensely curious. I knew from working with him on Evolve OS (which eventually became Solus) - that he was a genius and a workhorse. So, naturally, I wanted to be a part of whatever he was doing. When he told me he was building a game engine and working on his first title, I was a bit shocked but also ready to help out. Most of my high school and college years were spent developing 2D RPGs and so game development is a very interesting to me.

My day job is as the [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://thunderbird.net) Community and Business Development Manager, and Ikey and I thought the skills I've used in growing that project could help Lispy Snake. The world could use a great open source game engine and game company that considers Linux a first-class citizen, and a great way to fund the development of that is by making awesome games! I'll do what I can to help this snake with a speech impediment grow into a mighty serpent!

### Lispy Snake's First Game

I have to say that having insight into the development of the first title, it has already blown my expectations. A story-driven space game with awesome ship battles, fleet and crew management, and a special mode that the team is going to tease later. It is everything I've wanted out of a strategy game for a long time, as far as gameplay is concerned. I've worked to develop the plot - so it is also, of course, what I've wanted out of a game story. In playing modern titles lately I've found them to be more like a movie than a game, too brief and shallow - not giving room for discovery and freedom. Lispy Snake's new title will feature real storytelling that is engaging but, since it is a game, also allows you to blaze your own path at the same time.

Beyond working on the story for the first game, I've begun helping with coming up with some of the game's gameplay mechanics that I hope will make for a fun and engaging experience. From managing your resources, building out your base, and hiring your crew to blasting and boarding ships. We just know that you'll love our new game as much as we do.

### A New Kind of Gaming Company

Having open source underpin a game studio is new and strange, and frankly, that's what I love about Lispy Snake. By open sourcing the things that make us successful we hope that we can inspire others to do the same. We also hope that the world will appreciate us sharing our secret sauce and will reward us for doing so. Already we have released some great tools over on [our Github](https://github.com/lispysnake). We hope that you'll buy a copy of the game and help support us going forward.

Help us do something awesome and create a company that makes great games while sharing all the work we do that makes that possible.
