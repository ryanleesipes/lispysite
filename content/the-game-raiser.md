# The Game Raiser

For a limited time, we're running an investment crowdfunding opportunity in
Lispy Snake, Ltd. We're offering a lifetime license for all of our upcoming
2D game titles, for only $20!

There are only *1,000* licenses available during this run. This bootstrap
will help get our first title out even quicker, giving you lifetime access
to all of our upcoming 2D game titles. Oh, and Linux support is a given. {{<fontawesome fab fa-linux>}} {{<fontawesome fa fa-heart>}}

## The Engine

Once our first title is well underway, we'll open source our game engine.
This engine is written in modern C with a cross-platform focus, leveraging
the powerful [SDL](https://libsdl.org) libraries. Additionally we'll have
modular support libraries in a cohesive namespace, creating a powerful
and easy-to-use engine.

This engine is designed to be highly performant, and reduce time-to-market
for indie game developers. We're implementing a 3D pipeline using Vulkan
and OpenGL, but allowing the developer to think and work in 2D.

We're not targeting the oversaturated 'game-editor' market, rather, we
wish to provide an engine designed solely for developers wishing to
create robust, crossplatform and engaging 2D games quickly.

## [The Last Peacekeeper](/the-last-peacekeeper)

Our first game is helping us to build the engine in parallel. The game is called 
The Last Peacekeeper and it features amazing mechanics and story.
Think, 'Battlestar Galactica\*' meets 'Homeworld\*' in an awesome 2D strategy-esque
mashup. Dark storylines, heartbreaks and hope-crushers are the norm.
The storyline will take precedence over visuals, taking you on a journey
with our realistic, gritty characters as they face up to the human condition
in new levels of isolation.

## Support It Now

Our timescale is largely dependent right now on reinvestment from our
contracting work, meaning the game development is currently happening
'between gigs'. With The Game Raiser, you'll get lifetime access to
all of our future titles, and help to significantly reduce time to market
for our engine and first title.
